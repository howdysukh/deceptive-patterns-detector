This is a browser EXTENSION developed by team Innovesphere, a team of **First Year CSE** Students of [Chandigarh University](https://cuchd.in/) , for the [DBPH](https://dpbh2023.in) Hackathon, to detect and mitigate the dark patterns on various websites, which can be most extensively employed on the ecommerce platforms.This ensures that the user experience is improved along with protecting the consumer's rights and intrests.

## History
In late 2019's , Govt. Of india- Consumers Affairs, drafted an law against eCom websites , and now , finally in 2023, the act had successfully passed! The government has banned the use of " dark patterns " on e-commerce platforms under the guidelines issued by the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). The move is aimed to protect consumers' interest. These "dark patterns" on e-commerce websites are said to be intended to deceive customers or manipulate their choices.

Dark patterns are user interface design choices crafted to trick users into taking actions they might not otherwise perform, often to the detriment of the user.
