## Appendix

The Dark Pattern Finder Tool is designed to identify and analyze dark patterns on eCommerce websites. Dark patterns are user interface design choices crafted to trick users into taking actions they might not otherwise perform, often to the detriment of the user. This tool aims to promote transparency and user trust by highlighting instances of dark patterns.

## Features

- can detect dark patterns in most of the ecommerce sites such as amazon, flipkart, shopsy,etc
- employs Machine learning and NLP(Natural Language processing) to analyse each and every piece of text on the site
- Live dark pattern score for the websites
- Immediate plugin available to report the dark patterns - DAPDE
- Highlights to the user the dark patterns, and alerts him/her to make more careful decisions while surfing through ecommerce sites.
- Acts like a small popup extension, without actually interfering with the end user's shopping experience.


## Optimizations

recently made Optimizations include the redesigning of the UI/UX interface of the extension, and improving the design to be more user friendly.
